This repository is created for **IE221 – Probability** course, **Teamwork 4**.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to document the simulation codes developed in
Teamwork 3 and to present a technical analysis of the results obtained from
probabilistic simulations.

The project focuses on:
- Experimental verification of the **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**,
- Experimental verification of the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**,
- **Monte Carlo estimation of the value of π**.

## Code Documentation
All simulation codes are written in Python and are fully documented with:
- Function descriptions (docstrings),
- Inline comments for clarity,
- Clean and readable code structure.

The source codes are located in the `src/` folder.

## Methodology
Random sampling and Monte Carlo simulation techniques are used to illustrate
different modes of convergence and probabilistic limit theorems.

## Results
The results of the simulations are presented through graphical visualizations,
including convergence plots, histograms, and comparison with theoretical values.
All figures are stored in the `results/` folder.

## Technical Report
A detailed technical report including theoretical background, methodology,
results, and discussion is provided in PDF format under the `reports/` folder.
