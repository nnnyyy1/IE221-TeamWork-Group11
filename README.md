This repository is created for **IE221 – Probability** course, **Team Work 3**.  
The main goal is to:
- Experimentally verify the **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**,
- Experimentally verify the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**,
- Apply these ideas to a **Monte Carlo estimation of π**.

All simulations are implemented using Python in the `src/` folder, and the results are stored under `results/`
